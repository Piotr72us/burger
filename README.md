## Description
Welcome to my burger app! This app utilizes node.js, handlebars, my own orm, express routes, and SQL database in order to create and display new burgers for a restaurant menu. The status of the burger can be changed with one click from "ordered" to "devoured" and then the burger will be then displayed on the right side of the screen. Have fun using the app!
