## Description
Welcome to my burger page! This app utilizes node.js, handlebars, ORM, express routes, and SQL database in order to create a space to add and display new burgers for a restaurant. The status of the burger can be changed with one click from "ready to be eaten" :smile: to "devoured" and the burger will be then displayed on the right side of the screen. Have fun using the app!
